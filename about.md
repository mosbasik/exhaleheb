## What Is This?

"Exhale" is a life group affiliated with [Covenant Church Colleyville](http://www.covenantcolleyville.org/), welcoming new members from the Hurst-Euless-Bedford community.

Our name was inspired by the title track of Christian artist Plumb's 2015 album, _Exhale_:

## What Do You Do?

We gather on Tuesday evenings to encourage one another by personal applications of the Sunday message;  to consider together what Father is speaking into our lives through verses He's shown us, songs we've heard, books we've read, or events in our days;  in general, to share our 24/7 walk of faith with Jesus.

You can read more about our vision for this group on our [mission page](/mission).

## Who Are You?
