## What Is the Group About?

"Exhale" is a life group affiliated with [Covenant Church Colleyville](http://www.covenantcolleyville.org/), welcoming new members - especially if you're from the Hurst-Euless-Bedford community, as we would love to build up our local community.

Our name was inspired by the title track of Christian artist Plumb's 2015 album, _Exhale_:

## What Does the Group Do?

We gather on Tuesday evenings to encourage one another by personal applications of the Sunday message;  to consider together what Father is speaking into our lives through verses He's shown us, songs we've heard, books we've read, or events in our days;  in general, to share our 24/7 walk of faith with Jesus.

You can read more about our vision for this group on our [mission page]({{ site.baseurl }}/mission).

## Who Are the Leaders?

We're Timothy and Sharon Henry, a couple that has been a member of Covenant Church (in one form or another) since 1975.  We served as missionaries in [Lodja, D.R.Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodja) from 1994 to 2011, and since then have been living in Bedford.

Built, ran and trained staff for a medical facility in Lodja specializing in eye care and surgery, and served the local church body by leading small groups for adults, high school boys and elementary boys.  Coordinated a translation program with the goal of providing local pastors with training material and Christian books in their native languages.
