## In Person

Easiest is to meet us at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/My+Location/3508+Glade+Rd+Colleyville+TX+76034" target="_blank">Covenant Church Colleyville</a>.  This is what we look like:

Sunday mornings:

- We usually attend the first service in the main auditorium.
- We assist with the Legendary Youth program during the second service, so you can often find us in and around the Family Life Center auditorium, cafe or loft before and after the second service.
- We attend the third service occasionally.

Wednesdays:

- We also assist Legendary Youth on Wednesday nights, so check the Family Life Center after that as well.
