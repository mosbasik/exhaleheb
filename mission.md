God breathed life into Adam[^1], and Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit into His disciples[^2].

We too breatheâ€”expressing His living Word to one another and to those around us, like sweet perfume![^3]

So come on... inhale all you need... then **exhale**!

Let's gather around Jesus:

Sharing our walk beside Him,  
Sharing our Words from Him,  
Sharing our worship of Him,  
Sharing our burdens with Him,  
Sharing our joys in Him,  
Sharing life in the Spirit as the Father's children!

If we live, we live to HONOR the Lord.[^4]

Life in God's Family does not consist of eating and drinking, but consists of rightly _relating_ to Him and to one another in peace and joy, through the help of the Holy Spirit... Let us therefore make every effort to do [and SAY] the things that lead to peace, and things by which we may build one another up.[^5]

May God who gives endurance and encouragement help you live in complete harmony with one another, as is fitting for followers of Jesus Christ.  Then all of you can join together with one _voice_, giving praise and glory to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.[^6]

Sanctify Christ in your heart as Lord, always ready to _express_ to anyone who asks the reason for the hope that is in you, doing so with gentleness and respect.[^7]

Thanks be to God, who always leads us as captives in Christ's triumphal procession and uses us to spread the _aroma_ of the knowledge of Him everywhere.  For we are to God the pleasing _aroma_ of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.[^8]

Life is more than eating and drinking; more than working, playing and sleeping.  Life in Christ is more than going to church, having the "fire insurance policy" paid up, and doing or not doing this or that.  It's about enjoying relationship based on the completed work of Christ.  It's about being a body whose diverse parts are all well put together and smoothly function as the image of God our Creator.  It's about the flow of life from Jesus to all who are adopted into His family and from each of them into all the world.  So just take a good deep breath of God air... then **exhale**!
