Celebrating Rosh Hashana, Jewish New Year, Feast of Trumpets

Year of Creation 5777:  Hebrew characters signifying, "Behold My covenant sign to eat and to observe the end of the old and the beginning of the new!"

As in Exodus 31:13

We find many expressions of 7s in God's Word.

This is a year of Sabbath rest from yokes of slavery, as Passover delivered from Egypt and slavery to an old master.

Or as Jesus said, "My yoke is easy, My burden is light."
