## Before getting started:

Jim Garlow: triple masters and PhD in church history and government.  Wrote _Well Versed_ - book that examines 30 of the most pressing issues facing America today (for example: taxes, debt, minimum wage, social security, national defence, racism, terrorism, marriage, etc, etc) and presents a biblical view on each.

Dr. Garlow has made 1000 copies available to us that are not being _sold_ at campuses - instead, please donate whatever amount you can for the book, and all proceeds will be allocated to the Washington DC Center for National Renewal two blocks from the White House that we are in the process of setting up.

Reminder that you're invited to the center's grand opening for the inaugural address next year - no matter who wins!

## What is the purpose of our government?

To protect citizens by restraining evildoers.

John Adams:

>Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.

Apostle Paul:

> Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. For he is God’s minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God’s minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience’ sake.  
[Romans 13:1‭-‬5 NKJV](http://bible.com/114/rom.13.1-5.NKJV)

The declaration of independence points out that our basic inalienable rights (Life liberty and pursuit of happiness) are not something government gave to us, and that it cannot take away.

## Three basic philosophies on human nature:


1. Humanity is basically good and any problems are from lack of funding or education.

2. Humanity basically evil and must be dominated and controlled.

3. Humanity was originally good but our exposure to and embrace of sin gave us a great capacity for evil. Salvation through Jesus can purify us from this state and give us potential for good again.

>“The heart is deceitful above all things, And desperately wicked; Who can know it?  
[Jeremiah 17:9 NKJV](http://bible.com/114/jer.17.9.NKJV)

Top drag racer in the world is a strong Christian. Anecdote about meeting him and talking about spiritual walk before a race. You can be a Christian and a good person and be at the top of your game and do great things.

If you think people are inherently good, you're hamstrung - you can't name your enemy and so can't defeat it.

## Religion and Law

Three branches of government: executive, judicial, legislative. Free of each other but interact to make sure the people overall benefit.

No democracy or free nation has lasted more than 200 years. America is 238 years old and in uncharted territory.

First amendment:

>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Warren Jeffs got life and 20 for his cult. Religious freedom is not freedom from the law or a license for abuse.

## Are all religions the same?

There is danger in multiculturalism, which rejects the founding father's views and replaces then with religious relativism.  Says religions are the same and so all should be treated equally.  But all religions are not the same:

- India. Had to walk through the poor and homeless to get to a store. Asked owner how he could live with it. He said it's not real. Asked for clarification. Described caste system. Nothing to do to change their plight. They're working through the reincarnation cycle.  Comes from a religion.

- Saudi Arabia no freedom for women. Walk ten steps behind men, cover face, can't get a drivers licence. Comes from religion.

- China is an atheist nation.  Some people have a lot and most have nothing. Atheism is a religion and has real fruit.

- America was born on Christian faith, one of freedom and how Christ has set you free. Turns out, everyone in the world wants to come to America.

Note: it's not bigotry to point out clear and evident differences between religions.  Citation: Mike spent years in religious studies.

## Democratic and Republican Platforms

Some ideas about abortion, marriage, and Israel directly from the Democratic and Republican platforms.

### Abortion

#### Democratic Party

>Committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice.  We believe unequivocally , like the majority of Americans, that every woman should have the access to quality reproductive health care services including safe and legal aboriton regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes or how she is insured.

>Continue to defend Planned Parenthood health centers.  We will continue to oppose - and seek to overturn - federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman's access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment.

>We will support sexual and reproductive health and rights around the globe in addition to expanding the availability of affordable family planning information and contraceptive supplies.  We believe that safe abortion must be part of comprehensive maternal and women's health care and included as part of America's global health programming.  Therefore we support the repeal of harmful restrictions that obstruct women's access to health care information and services including the "global gag rule" and the Helms Amendment that bars American assistance to provide safe, legal abortion throughout the developing world.

#### Republican Party

>We affirm our moral obligation to assist, rather than penalize women who face an unplanned pregnacy.  In order to encourage women who face an unplanned pregnancy to choose life, we support legislation that requires financial responsibility for the child be equally borne by both the mother th father upon conception until the child reaches adulthood.

>The Democratic Party is extreme on abortion.  Democrats' almost limitless support for abortion, and their strident opposotion to even the most basic restrictions on abortion, put them dramatically out of step with the American people.

Mike quotes 70% of Americans want abortion controlled or stopped. [Where did that number come from?]

What about rape or incest? Mike thinks abortion should be an option that can be brought to the table in those circumstances. However, he doesn't like that his taxes can be used to pay for abortions for people with irresponsible lifestyles.

#### Biblical View

But Mike, the Bible doesn't contain the word abortion...

>If you do not oppress the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and *do not shed innocent blood* in this place, or walk after other gods to your hurt, then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.  
[Jeremiah 7:6‭-‬7 NKJV](http://bible.com/114/jer.7.6-7.NKJV)

>If men fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that she gives birth prematurely, yet no harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman’s husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.  
[Exodus 21:22-25](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/exo.21.22-25.NKJV)

>“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations.”  
[Jeremiah 1:5 NKJV](http://bible.com/114/jer.1.5.NKJV)

>I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that  I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live;  
[Deuteronomy 30:19 NKJV](http://bible.com/114/deu.30.19.NKJV)

### Marriage

#### Democratic Party

>Democrats applaud last year's decsicion by the Supreme Court that recognized that LGBT people - like other Americans - have the right to marry the person they love.

>We support a progressive vision of religious freedom that respects pluralism and rejects the misuse of religion to discriminate.

Musing: How far are we from being unable to teach on what the scripture says is wrong without being prosecuted for illegal religious intolerance? I'm concerned that these lines are in the same paragraph..

#### Republican Party

>Foremost among those institutions is the American family.  It is the foundation of civil society, and the cornerstone of the family is natural marriage, the union of one man and one woman.

>Strong families, depending upon God and one another, advance the cause of liberty by lessening the need for government in their daily lives.

#### Biblical View

Note: I do not hate LGBT people, nor does this church.

>And He answered and said to them, “Have you not read that He who made  them at the beginning ‘made them male and female,’  and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’ ?  So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.”  
[Matthew 19:4‭-‬6 NKJV](http://bible.com/114/mat.19.4-6.NKJV)

Marriage _should_ be a church issue, not a government issue. It belongs to God.  Government legislating on marriage is like government legislating about how to water baptize. It's not its place.

[Note the _should_.  This is not currently the case and simply disallowing homosexual marriage is not sufficient to achieve this state. Also, the mirroring implication is that marriage should not affect tax status or citizen status.]

### Israel

#### Democratic Party

>We will continue to work toward a two-state solution of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict negotiated directly by the parties that guarantees Israel's future as a secure and democratic Jewish state with recognized borders and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignity, and dignity.

>While Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations, it should remain the capital of Israel, an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.

#### Republican Party

>Support for Israel is an expression of Americanism and it is the responsibility of our government to advance policies that reflect Americans' strong desire for a relationship with no daylight between America and Israel.  We recognize Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisable capital of the Jewish state and call for the American embassy to be moved there in fulfillment of U.S. law.

#### Biblical View

>Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “They shall again use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I bring back their captivity: ‘The Lord bless you, O home of justice, and  mountain of holiness!’  
[Jeremiah 31:23 NKJV](http://bible.com/114/jer.31.23.NKJV)

>But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; For behold, I create Jerusalem as a rejoicing, And her people a joy. I will rejoice in Jerusalem, And joy in My people; The voice of weeping shall no longer be heard in her, Nor the voice of crying.  
[Isaiah 65:18‭-‬19 NKJV](http://bible.com/114/isa.65.18-19.NKJV)

## Closing Thoughts

Charge to you: be responsible.

Step down to a lower level as an American and get ready to exercise your greatest power in a democracy.

You can't not vote.

Educate yourself.  (This does not mean simply watch the news).

Pray.

When you enter the voting booth, know that you have been educated, you're prayed up, and step forward in faith.

I (Mike) will never tell you who to vote for, only what principles you should vote for.
