Speaker: Mike Hayes

"Under God" - Phrase not in original pledge
Added in fifties by Eisenhower because of the revivals with Billy Graham etc

We can return to that state
Avoid prejudice - pre judging
Not attempting to build a theocracy like, say, Iran
We are dual citizens, of the kingdom and the United States

“You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men. “You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.  Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.  Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.
[Matthew 5:13‭-‬16 NKJV](http://bible.com/114/mat.5.13-16.NKJV)

Sight is revelation. You see what's coming - not because you're smart but because you see.

Holding two documents. GOP and Democrat platforms. About 50 pages each.
Sometimes the candidate doesn't matter as much as the agenda.
Good people say nothing because they don't want to be wrong but they don't know what to say.

## Three Misunderstandings in America about the church:

### Pastor cannot discuss political matters or parties in the church

Origin: 2 businessmen made a religious organization in order to donate to defeat LBJ. LBJ won and came back and made a law that the chair of a 501ck (maybe?) cannot speak on politics. It was never intended to target legitimate churches. IRS has never removed tax status of churches for this reason.

### Separation of church of state

Origin: Thomas Jefferson wrote to Danberry Baptists worried about the reach of the government into church affairs. Intent was to protect church from government, not exclude church tenets from government.

### Judge not, that you not be judged

“Judge  not, that you be not judged.  For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.
[Matthew 7:1‭-‬2 NKJV](http://bible.com/114/mat.7.1-2.NKJV)

This is not a prohibition on judgment. This just warns that you should not judge in a way that you do not want to be judged by.
